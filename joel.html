      <p class="paragraphs">Hello people. I am Joel. I was born in the USA in the state of California. I identify as a Miamian because I moved to Miami, Fl. before I was a teenager. I have Mexican heritage but I was raised my Cubans. That means, culturaly I am a Cuban. I do feel very American and I am very proud of that, as everyone should be of there own country.</p>
      <p class="paragraphs">I have a few hobbies like cooking, wood working, gaming, drawing, baking, music, dancing, and many more. Anyone who knows me knows that I am a foody. I do enjoy a good home cooked meal! That is why I bake, cook, and barbiecue.</p>
      <p class="paragraphs">To be more exact, I grew up in Hialeah. It is not a small town by any means. It is one of Miami's neighboring cities. It borders Miami spring, Hialeah Gardens, Virginia Gardens, Miami Gardens, Miami Lakes, Miami, and Browwnsville.</p>
      <p class="paragraphs">I grew up in the sunshine not only in California but also in Miami. I love the beach a lot. There is nothing as nice as floating in warm tropical waters. The scenery, the smell, the sounds; in general everything about a tropical place is super awesome. I know not everyone is a beach person, I can't understand it; but I know.</p>
