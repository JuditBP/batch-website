        <p>Hello people. I am Joel. I was born in the USA in the state of California. I identify as a Miamian because I moved to california before I was a teenager. I have Mexican heritage but I was raised my Cuabns. That means culturaly I am a Cuban. I do feel very American and I am very proud of that, as everyone should be of there own country.</p>
        <p>I have a few hobbies like cooking, wood working, gaming, drawing, baking, and many more. I hope everyone reading this page a good day.</p>
