      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        <em>
          I’m a 30-year-old photographer originally from Poland, now living in Germany. For the past eight years, I’ve dedicated myself to capturing the world through my camera, turning moments into art.
          Photography has been more than just a career for me—it’s become a core part of who I am. Now, with nearly a decade of experience behind me, I’m taking a bold step forward by launching my own model agency and photography company.
          This new venture is the culmination of my passion and ambition, driven by a desire to create images that are not only visually stunning but also meaningful.
          I’m excited to build a platform where I can showcase emerging talent and bring my unique vision to life.
          As I embark on this journey, I’m not just capturing moments—I’m creating opportunities and shaping a space where art meets business.
          The world through my lens is about to get a whole lot bigger, and I can’t wait to see where this path leads.
